# LandChad.net ([https://landchad.net](https://landchad.net))

A site dedicated to turn web peasants into Internet LandChads.

Simple step-by-step text and image-based tutorials for creating websites, email servers, chat servers, server administration and everything else.

Suggestions welcome.

This site is compiled and organized with Hugo, using [this very simple theme](https://github.com/lukesmithxyz/lugo).

## Submission guidelines

- Guides should be made for the most recent stable version of Debian. (Now Debian 11.)
- Follow the general style of pre-existing articles.
- use the root user (i.e. no `sudo`) unless there is a specific need.
- do not preface commands with `$` or `#` or anything.
- use `.svg` files for icons/logos and for illustrative images favor webp, keep filesize low.
- Use `example.org` the example domain.
- Do not add Docker tutorials.
- Installable services must have the `service` tag and an `icon` set in the metadata so they properly appear in the service display.
- Server/sysadmin tips should have the `server` tag, so they appear in that list.
