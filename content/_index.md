This is LandChad.net, a site dedicated to turning internet peasants into Internet Landlords by showing them how to setup websites, email servers, chat servers and everything in between.

Starting a website is something that can be done in a lazy afternoon and costs pocket change.

Most of the internet's problems could be solved if more people had their own personal platforms, so the objective of this site is to guide any normal person through the process of installing a website.
