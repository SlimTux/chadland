<p>Cron is a service that lets you run scheduled tasks on a computer. These tasks
are called <strong>cronjobs.</strong> If you have already followed the initial course you
will have already used cron when you set up Certbot, but we&rsquo;ll explain how they work generally here.</p>
<h2 id="what-tasks-would-i-want-to-schedule">What tasks would I want to schedule?</h2>
<p>You can schedule anything! Some examples of what you might have done
already include:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>updatedb</code> to update your <code>locate</code> database to let you quicking search for files</li>
<li><code>certbot</code> to update renewing of your https certs</li>
</ul>
<p>Some tasks that you might <em>want</em> to schedule may include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Package updates - if you really just want to leave your server alone
you can automated updating packages on your server</li>
<li>Backups - you may want to backup certain files every day and some
every week, this is possible with cron</li>
</ul>
<p>And many more, anything you can do can be turned into a cronjob.</p>
<h2 id="basic-cronjobs">Basic Cronjobs</h2>
<p>This the preferred method for personal tasks and scripts; it's also the
easiest to get started with. Run the command <code>crontab -e</code> to access your
user's crontab</p>
<p>Once you have figured out the command you want to run you need to figure
out how often you want to run it and when. I am going to schedule my
system updates once a week on at 3:30 AM on Mondays.</p>
<p>We now have to convert this time (Every Monday at 3:30 AM) into a cron
time. Cron uses a simple but effective way of scheduling when to run
things.</p>
<p>Crontab expressions look like this <code>* * * * * command-to-run</code> The five
elements before the command tell when the command is supposed to be run
automatically.</p>
<p>So for our Monday at 3:30 AM job we would do the following:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-txt" data-lang="txt"><span style="display:flex;"><span> .---------------- minute (0 - 59)
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span> | .------------- hour (0 - 23)
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span> | | .---------- day of month (1 - 31)
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span> | | | .------- month (1 - 12)
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span> | | | | .---- day of week (0 - 6)
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span> | | | | |
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span> * * * * *
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>30 3 * * 1 apt -y update &amp;&amp; apt -y upgrade
</span></span></code></pre></div><h3 id="some-notes">Some notes</h3>
<ul>
<li>On the day of the week option, Sunday is 0 and counting up from
there, Saturday will be 6.</li>
<li><code>*</code> designates &quot;everything&quot;. Our command above has a <code>*</code> in the
day of month and month columns. This means it will run regardless of
the day of the month or month.</li>
<li>The hour option uses 24 hour time. 3 = 3AM, while use 15 for 3PM.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="more-examples">More examples</h3>
<p>Let's add another job, our backup job (for the purposes of this our
backup command is just called <code>backup</code>). We want to run <code>backup</code> every
evening at 11PM. Once we work out the timings for this we can add the to
the same file as the above by running <code>crontab -e</code> This would mean our
full crontab would look like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-txt" data-lang="txt"><span style="display:flex;"><span>0 23 * * * backup
</span></span></code></pre></div><h3 id="consecutive-times">Consecutive times</h3>
<p>Suppose we want a command to run every weekday. We know we can put <code>1</code>
(Monday), but we can also use <code>1-5</code> to signify from day 1 (Monday) to
day 5 (Friday).</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-txt" data-lang="txt"><span style="display:flex;"><span>0 6 * * 1-5 echo &#34;Wakey, wakey, wagie!&#34; &gt;&gt; /home/wagie/alarm
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The above <code>echo</code> command runs every Monday through Friday at 6:00AM.</p>
<h3 id="non-consecutive-times">Non-consecutive times</h3>
<p>We can also randomly specify non-consecutive arguments with a comma.
Suppose you have a script you want to run at the midday of the 1st,
15th, and 20th day of every month. You can specify that by putting
<code>1,15,20</code> for the day of the month argument:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-txt" data-lang="txt"><span style="display:flex;"><span>0 12 1,15,20 * * /usr/bin/pay_bills_script
</span></span></code></pre></div><h3 id="every-x-minutesdaysmonths">&quot;Every X minutes/days/months&quot;</h3>
<p>We can also easily run a command every several minutes or months,
without specifying the specific times:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-txt" data-lang="txt"><span style="display:flex;"><span>*/15 * * * * updatedb
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This cronjob will run the <code>updatedb</code> command every 15 minutes.</p>
<h3 id="beware-of-this-rookie-mistake-though">Beware of this Rookie Mistake Though...</h3>
<p>Suppose you want to run a script once every other month. You might be
<em>tempted</em> write this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-txt" data-lang="txt"><span style="display:flex;"><span>* * * */2 *
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>That might <em>feel right</em>, but this script <em>will be running once every
minute during that every other month</em>. You should specify the first two
arguments, because with <code>*</code> it will be running every minute and hour!</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-txt" data-lang="txt"><span style="display:flex;"><span>0 0 1 */2 *
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This makes the command run <em>only</em> at 0:00 (12:00AM) on the first day of
every two months, which is what we really want.</p>

<h2 id="user-vs-root-cronjobs">User vs. Root Cronjobs</h2>
<p>It is important to note that user accounts all have different cronjobs.
If you have a user account <code>chad</code> and edit his crontab with
<code>crontab -e</code>, the commands you add will be run as the <code>chad</code> user, not
<code>root</code> or anyone else.</p>
<p>Bear in mind that if you need root access to run a particular command,
you will usually want to add it as root.</p>
<h2 id="system-wide-cron-directories">System-wide cron directories</h2>
<p><code>crontab -e</code> is the typical interface for adding cronjobs, but it's
important to at least know that system-wide jobs are often stored in the
file directory. Some programs which need cronjobs will automatically
install them in the following way.</p>
<p>Run the command <code>ls /etc/cron*</code> you should see a list of directories and
there contents. The directories should be something like the below:</p>
<ul>
<li>/etc/cron.d <em>This is a crontab like the ones that you create with</em>
<code>crontab -e</code></li>
<li>/etc/cron.hourly</li>
<li>/etc/cron.daily</li>
<li>/etc/cron.weekly</li>
<li>/etc/cron.monthly</li>
</ul>
<p>The directories cron.{hourly,daily,weekly,monthly} are where you can put
<strong>scripts</strong> to run at those times. You don't put normal cron entries
here. I prefer to use these directories for system wide jobs that don't
relate to an individual user.</p>
