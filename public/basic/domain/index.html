<p>When domain names first sell, they usually sell for very cheap, but once
someone buys one, they have the rights to it until they decide to sell
it, often for much, much more money. Therefore, it's a good idea to
reserve a domain name ASAP, even if you didn't intend on doing anything
big with it.</p>
<p>So let's register your domain name!</p>
<h2 id="how">How</h2>
<p>Domains can be registered at any accredited <dfn>registrar</dfn>. In this
guide, I will use the registrar
<a href="https://www.epik.com/?affid=we2ro7sa6">Epik</a> because it is one of the
more high quality and easy to use. The guides on this site will use
Epik, but if you choose to register your domain with one of the <a href="https://www.icann.org/en/accredited-registrars">many,
many other registrars</a>,
you can still do most of what Epik does, albeit options and settings
might appear in different menus.</p>
<h3 id="basic-info-about-domain-names">Basic info about domain names</h3>
<ul>
<li>Domain names usually require a <em>very</em> small year fee to keep
registered, usually around $12 for most generic TLDs. There are
some &quot;specialty&quot; TLDs that are more expensive, but <code>.com</code>, <code>.xyz</code>
and other basic TLDs are that cheap.</li>
<li>Once you own a domain, it is yours as long as you pay the yearly
fee, but you can also sell it to someone for however much you want.</li>
<li>Domain names do not hold your data or your website, instead, you add
&quot;DNS settings&quot; that direct people connecting to your domain to
your IP address. The purpose of a domain name is so that people
don't have to remember your IP address to find your website!</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="looking-for-domain-names">Looking for domain names</h3>
<p>Let's go to <a href="https://www.epik.com/?affid=we2ro7sa6">Epik's site</a> and
you can search for domain names.</p>
<p>You can look for whatever domain name you want. Domains that are already
bought and owned by someone else might have the option to &quot;Backorder,&quot;
but it's always best to get one that is unowned, like these:</p>

<p>Note the differences in prices. Some &quot;specialty&quot; TLDs like <code>.game</code> and
<code>.io</code> charge a much larger fee, although you might want one. Some
domains above, like <code>.xyz</code> and <code>.org</code> have reduced prices for the first
year.</p>
<p>Choose the domain you want and buy it. These <code>.xyz</code> domains are a steal
now on sale.</p>

<p>That's all you have to do to own a domain name! As you register a
domain, you can also setup an automatic payment to pay your fee yearly
to keep your domain. Easy as pie.</p>
<p>Now we will get a server to host your website on.</p>
